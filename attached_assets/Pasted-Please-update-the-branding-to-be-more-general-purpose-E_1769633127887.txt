Please update the branding to be more general-purpose. Expert in the Loop (EITL) should be positioned as a general tool for collecting human expert feedback on LLM and AI agent outputs, not specifically biomedical entity validation. Biomedical mapping is just one use case.
Updated branding language:
Page Title & Meta:

Title: "Expert in the Loop | Human Review for AI Outputs"
Meta description: "Collect structured human expert feedback on LLM-generated matches, classifications, and recommendations. Build gold standard datasets to evaluate and improve AI systems."

Login Page:

Main heading: "Expert in the Loop"
Tagline: "Human expert validation for AI-generated outputs"
Subtext (optional): "Build gold standard datasets through structured expert review of LLM matches, classifications, and recommendations."

About/Description text (for footer, about page, or onboarding):
Expert in the Loop (EITL) is a platform for collecting structured human feedback 
on AI-generated outputs. Use it to:

- Validate LLM-suggested matches and mappings
- Review AI classifications and categorizations  
- Evaluate agent-generated recommendations
- Build calibrated ground truth datasets
- Measure inter-rater reliability across expert reviewers

Designed for teams who need systematic human review to evaluate, improve, 
and trust their AI systems.
UI text replacements:

"Biomedical entity mapping validation" → "AI output validation"
"entity mappings" → "AI-generated pairs" or just "pairs"
"biomedical" → remove or replace with "expert"
Domain placeholder: keep "expertintheloop.io"

Campaign type labels (keep flexible):

Instead of hardcoding "questionnaire_match" and "loinc_mapping" as the only types, the UI should treat campaign_type as a user-defined string
Example types: "match_validation", "classification_review", "recommendation_quality", "extraction_accuracy", etc.

Color scheme / visual identity:

Keep it professional and neutral (not specifically medical/clinical looking)
Suggest: Clean blues/grays, or a subtle purple accent to suggest AI/intelligence without being too "techy"

The goal is that someone using this for legal document review, content moderation QA, or product recommendation validation would feel equally at home as someone doing biomedical ontology mapping.
